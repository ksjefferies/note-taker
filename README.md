## Description:  

The Note Taker (TNT) 

-------

## Objectives:
```

- TPG is a command-line application that accepts user input to enter all data.
- When the manager starts the information, they will need to answer the default questions:
    * Name (default)
    * Employee ID (default)
    * Email Address (default)
    * Office Number (Manager question only)

    
```
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
